<p>React has always been on my list of things to master (right after shitposting and patrish music selection lmao). Today I'll try to build the de facto first react project, a todo list :)</p>

<p><i>Note: I hate writing, please bear with me if this post isn't very long.</i></p>

<h3>Starting Dev</h3>
<p>Before starting I'm making a small mockup in Sketch, so that I know exactly what I'm doing. Here's what I came up with - </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

<p>Excuse my terrible design skills. I'm going to bootstrap the project using <code>create-react-app</code> because I don't know webpack well enough to setup my own config. I usually clean up the stuff that <code>create-react-app</code> adds, I'm going to delete <code>logo.svg</code>, <code>App.test.js</code> (my code is my test *angery*) and <code>registerServiceWorker.js</code>, also remove imports/referrences to these files in other files.</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b> If you want to host your build on Github Pages, you'll need to rename the <code>build</code> directory to <code>docs</code>. You could do that manually or setup a <code>postbuild</code> task in your <code>package.json</code>. The <code>postbuild</code> task is automatically run by yarn or npm after the build task. Add the postbuild task to your package.json like this - </p>

<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/angad19/28f6024aef43710e71094320afbec86c.js"></script></p>

<p>If you're hosting on Github pages, you'll also want to change the homepage field in your package.json (read about it in the build task's output).</p>

<p>I'll start by adding a header component, followed by a todo input component.</p>

<p>While trying to get submit on enter to work, I came across a weird problem. I passed a function to the <code>input</code> element which printed out <code>e.keyCode</code> and I would always get 0. I googled around and found that I had to use <code>e.which</code> instead. Might be helpful for y'all.</p>

<p>Okay, I have basic functionality working, now I just need to display the todos and work on deletions (which I'm guessing is the hardest part?). Let's talk a little about the app. The header and todo input components are both stateless and functional, only the App component has state. I'm passing down functions for <code>onKeyPress</code> and <code>onChange</code> via props (Tip: use arrow functions to define methods in classes, you don't have to bind them to <code>this</code> that way). I'm using the value attribute of the input element to empty it when the user presses enter (pass down state, set on keyPress). The <code>onKeyPress</code> function just pushes the todoItem to the todos array in state and empties the todo input element.</p>

<p>Displaying todos works. All I had to do was have one todo list component and one todo component, then map over an array in the props in the todo list component and render a todo component for each todo in the todos array.</p>


<p>Finished. Implementing deletion was a lot easier than I expected. All I had to was splice the array at the key.</p>
