<p>I'm writing an RSS Reader. Why you may ask? Good question. Because I'm bored, and writing code is fun.</p>

<p>I'm going to use Express and React for this project, again because using React is fun and I'm familiar with Express.</p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>

<p>Now let's talk about how the app will actually work. I'm not going to go into user auth or anything like that. This will be a single user application, which probably no one other than me will ever use.</p>

<p>I'm going to have one API for all the frontends I might make. Other than the React webapp, I'm also thinking of doing a React Native mobile app. For keeping the list of feeds synced between multiple devices, I'll use a Dropbox file. I was going to use Google Drive but OAuth fucked my brain. The Dropbox SDK is super simple to use, they just give you an Access Token and you can get on with your life. I played around with it a little today, and it seems easy enough, I didn't have much time though and could only get listing files to work.</p>

<p>I'll keep y'all posted about the progess of this project and if I run into any problems. I'm gonna go sleep now, I have a long ass day. I'm really fucking excited about <a href="https://byteclub.in/byte_it/home">Byte.IT</a> tomorrow, it seems like a really nice event. Had one of the most innovative cryptic hunts on the tech circuit. I like how they took the best parts of CTFs and cryptic hunts and merged them together. I'll probably talk about the creative event too tomorrow.</p>
