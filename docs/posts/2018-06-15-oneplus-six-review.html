<p>My phone (a <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/samsung-galaxy-a5-2107">Samsung Galaxy A5</a>) was due for an upgrade. I wanted something that wasn't very expensive, snappy, had a good camera, a workday's battery life and a decent ammount of storage. I decided to go with the <a href="https:/oneplus.in/6">Oneplus 6</a>. I've had some experience with Oneplus phones before, I had the <a href="https://www.oneplus.in/5">Oneplus 5</a> before it suffered a tragic death on the road outside my school (RIP).</p>

<p>My Oneplus 5 could handle anything I threw at it, was a joy to use and lasted hours. That's exactly what I expected from it's successor, a fast, beautiful phone which felt amazing. I ordered the base model in Mirror Black, mostly because that was all I could afford, but also becasue I didn't feel I'd need anything more.</p>

<p>The Mirror Black variant is very slippery and collects a lot of fingerprints, fortunately Oneplus sends you a case in the box. The phone looks and feels extremely beautiful. The design is pretty consistent with the OP5 but the OP6 has a glass back. The glass back feels a lot smoother in the hand, and personally I prefer it over the OP5's metal back.</p>

<p>The camera is amazing. It takes great photos. I'm not gonna talk about a lot about technical details of the dual lens setup, but portrait mode is stil shit. Photos without portrait mode look amazing. It does a lot better than the OP5 in low-light situations. I still wish they would've done what LG did with their dual lens setup (main shooter + wide angle), but it's okay I don't take a lot of photos with my phone anyway.</p>

<p>Perfomance-wise, the OP6 is a beast. It is the definition of a fast flagship. The software optimisations make it feel even smoother.</p>

<p>While we're talking about software, I'd like to mention how great OxygenOS is. It's very close to stock Android but has all the little thing I wish stock Android had, like a system-wide dark mode. I also really like how Oneplus dealt with the notch, the ability to control it's behavior from app-to-app and the ability to completely disable it are great. As a open hater of this trend, I can tolerate the OP6's notch.</p>

<p>The fingerprint scanner is fast and you can get in and out of the phone fairly quickly. I disabled face unlock mostly because of how unsecure it is (pfft), also because sometimes I open my phone just to glance at the time and I wouldn't want to unlock my phone when I do that. I did run into some problems where the phone wouldn't unlock if I only touched the fingerprint scanner, I'd have to press the power button first, but those were pretty rare and I haven't noticed any after the latest sofware update.</p>

<p>Oneplus doesn't have great service in the States. But here in Delhi, there are quite a few official service centres, and their repair charges are a lot more reasonable than most other companies.</p>

<p>I saved the best for last! The edge-to-edge display looks absolutely stunning. I've always liked AMOLED displays because of how good they are in the dark, but this one is on another level. The panel is 1080p, but I've never noticed it. Even when I compared it to a Galaxy S9, I couldn't see a huge difference in sharpness. In the Youtube app, you can pinch out to fill the whole screen with the video, this mode does crop some of the video but it's very immersive and I sometimes prefer it over the standard view with letterboxing.</p>

<p>Overall, the OP6 is a great phone. Fast, beautiful, practical and affordable, exactly what I expected from Oneplus. It does have a few rough edges. Overall, I'd give it a 9/10. I wish Oneplus made a cheaper phone, one that wasn't as fast or beautiful, but still did the job gracefully. Fresh Oneplus releases are still pretty uncommon among average Indians, most people can only afford to spend 10 to 15,000rs (about 200$) on their phones and even though Oneplus offers amazing value, their phones are still out of reach for many Indians.</p>
