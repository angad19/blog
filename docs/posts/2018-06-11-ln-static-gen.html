<p>I've started building a lot more projects. I wanted to write about problems I ran into, tools I used and just general stuff. I've tried a lot of ways to blog, and almost all of them has some or the other problem which made them harder to use for me. <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> felt overkill, I don't know React so <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a> or anything React based was nto an option. I'm not great at Python, so most of the Python-based options were out too. I also wanted a nice weekend project to work on after my SSAT was over.</p>

<p>Writing my own generator was fun. It wasn't very difficult, but challenging enough to keep me interested. I wrote Ln in JavaScript, because I'm know JavaScript well enough to write useable software.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/angad19/ln">Ln</a> is a simple and extensible static site generator. It is made up of three components - <code>posts.json</code>, plugins and <code>config.js</code>. <code>posts.json</code> is read and an array of post objects is created. An ln plugin is just a function that takes an array of post objects and the config as params and returns a promise which resolves with an array of posts. So, for example, you could build a plugin that reads all org files in a directory, generates post objects from them and adds them to the posts array. After <code>awaiting</code> all the plugins, the modified array of post objects is written to <code>posts.json</code>. <code>config.js</code> exports an object whose properties can be accessed by all plugins.</p>

<p>You can then run the index script to run the build function which calls all the plugins.</p>
