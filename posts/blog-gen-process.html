<p>I've started building a lot more projects. I wanted to write about problems I ran into, tools I used and just general stuff. I've tried a lot of ways to blog, and pretty much none of them fit into my workflow. <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> felt overkill, I don't know React so <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a> or anything React based was not an option. I'm not great at Python, so most of the Python-based options were out too. I also wanted a nice weekend project to work on after my SSAT was over.</p>

<p>Writing my own generator was fun. It wasn't very difficult, but challenging enough to keep me interested. I wrote it in JavaScript, because I know JavaScript well enough to write usable software.</p>

<p>My generator basically just reads a directory of JavaScipt plugin files and executes them. A plugin file is just a file which exports a function which takes in an array of post objects and the config object as params and returns a promise that resolves with an array of post objects. The build script runs in <code>O(n)</code> and the plugins are executed one after another.</p>

<p>I wrote 6 plugins -
	<h5>clean</h5>
	<p>Delets the public directory, creates a new one and copies the assets folder from the source directory into the build directory</p>
	<h5>get-posts</h5>
	<p>Reads posts folder, generates post objects from HTML files and pushes them to the posts array</p>
	<h5>render-posts</h5>
	<p>Renders an EJS template for each post and places it in the build directory.</p>
	<h5>render-home</h5>
	<p>Renders the home EJS template.</p>
	<h5>rss</h5>
	<p>Generates an RSS feed using the posts array using the <a href="https://github.com/dylang/node-rss">node-rss</a> package and writes it to <code>build/feed.xml</code> .</p>
	<h5>less</h5>
	<p>Compiles LESS stylesheets into CSS and writes to a <code>style.css</code> file in the build directory.</p></p>

<p>I'm pretty happy with this setup. I can add and remove stuff pretty easily and I can edit the posts in Emacs in HTML mode. I'll write about any problems that come up.</p>
