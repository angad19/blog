<p>You can batch rename files with Dired.</p>

<p>Open a Dired buffer (<code>C-x d</code>) with the sirectory in which you want to batch rename files. Run <code>dired-toggle-read-only</code> (bound to <code>C-c C-q</code> in dired-mode). Edit the buffer and <code>C-c C-c</code> to save, <code>C-c C-k</code> to abort.</p>

<p>Yet another reason why Emacs is awesome!</p>
