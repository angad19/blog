<p>To see changes in the browser for this blog, I need to run the build script and refresh the browser manually. This can get tedious, so I decided to automate it.</p>

<p>This is pretty easy to do in Node, because Node was built for realtime things like this. The <code>fs</code> module has a <code>watch</code> function which can watch directories and do stuff when files change. I can just run the build script using <code>child_process.spawn</code>. Now I just need to find a way to reload the browser.</p>

<p>The easiest way I can think of doing that is with applescript. This snippet reloads the active chrome tab -<script src="https://gist.github.com/angad19/a2737a773827ad3c0c489411b375be3b.js"></script></p>

<p>Great! Now we can just run the <code>osascript -e</code> command to run this snippet.<script src="https://gist.github.com/angad19/885226238eea218ee06135d9cc542993.js"></script></p>

<p>All we have to do now is setup <code>fs.watch</code> to watch our directories. I decided to use <code>chokidar</code> to watch the files since it's kinda hard to watch subdirectories with <code>fs.watch</code>.</p>

<p>Here's the finished script - <script src="https://gist.github.com/angad19/96b8c2a987d0698be6fce3d3cc26093d.js"></script></p>

<p>Files beginning with <code>.#</code> are backup files created by Emacs, so we can ignore them. </p>
<p>The reload is kinda jerky but I don't mind it. I won't be looking at the browser constantly.</p>
